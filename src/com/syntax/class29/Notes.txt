Set in java:
    set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes for example
    HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeSet.
Properties of Set:
    All the Sets don't allow duplicates.
HashSet:
    1)HasSet does not maintain the insertion order
    2) it is the fastest in all Sets
    3) Most widely used Set.
LinkedHashSet:
    1) Maintains the insertion order
    2) slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet specially the insertions
TreeSet:
    1) Sorts the data in natural order. for number in increasing order
    2) it is slowest when it comes to store the data.
When to use which type of Set:
    1)If we don't care about insertion order and data being sorted always use Hashset
    2) if we need the insertion order we(Batch 12) don't have much choice
    we have to use the linkedHashset but if we don't care about the insertion order
    we can compare it with TreeSet
    LinkedHashset            vs     TreeSet
    Insertion is not slow           Slowest insertion
    Retrieval is super slow         slower than HashSet but faster than linkedHashset
I don't care about insertion order but, I care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
HashSet
I care about insertion order but, I don't care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
LinkedHashSet.
if i want to have sorted data all the time?
TreeSet
