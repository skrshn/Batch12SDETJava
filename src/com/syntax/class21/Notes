inheritance in Java (we can tell in interview):
It's a mechanism in java through which a child class gets the properties and methods from the parent class.

Benefits:
-Save times to code
-Code duplication is reduced
-Execution time is faster

Disadvantages:
Classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class.
We have to be careful when we try to change!

Types of Inheritance:
There are 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them.
1)Single
2)Hierarchical
3)Multilevel
-Multiple inheritance not supported in Java


Single Inheritance:
In Single Inheritance we have only one child and one parent class. or only two classes participate in inheritance
one as child one as parent.

class Parent{}
class Child extends Parent{}


Hierarchical Inheritance:
In Hierarchical Inheritance we have a single Parent class and multiple child classes.

class Parent{}
class Child1 extends Parent{}
class Child2 extends Parent{}


Multilevel Inheritance:
In Multilevel Inheritance we have multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have a class A, B, C
Class c will be inherited from B and b will be inherited from A.

class A{}
class B extends A{}
class C extends B{}
